# Active Context - Notes System

## Current Status: ALL ISSUES RESOLVED âœ…

### ðŸŽ‰ **BREAKTHROUGH ACHIEVEMENT** 
**File Download Issue COMPLETELY FIXED!**

#### Root Cause Identified and Fixed âœ…
- **Problem**: File path resolution using relative paths failed in production server
- **Solution**: Changed file manager to use `os.getcwd()` as base path instead of `Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent`
- **Result**: Download endpoints now return HTTP 200 with proper file delivery

#### Technical Fix Applied âœ…
```python
# OLD (Broken in production):
self.upload_dir = Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent / upload_dir

# NEW (Working perfectly):
current_dir = Path(os.getcwd())
self.upload_dir = current_dir / upload_dir
```

### System Status: FULLY OPERATIONAL âœ…
