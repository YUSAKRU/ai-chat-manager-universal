## Technology Context (techContext.md)

This document outlines the technologies, tools, and processes used for the development, testing, deployment, and continuous integration of the AI-Powered Note Taking System.

### Technologies Used

*   **Frontend:**
    *   **React:** JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Provides a component-based architecture for creating reusable UI elements.
    *   **TypeScript:** Superset of JavaScript that adds static typing. Improves code maintainability and reduces runtime errors.
    *   **Redux (with Redux Toolkit):** State management library for managing application data and complex interactions. Simplifies state updates and provides a predictable data flow.
    *   **Material UI (or similar component library):** React UI framework providing pre-built components for rapid development and consistent styling. Chosen based on design requirements and ease of customization.
    *   **HTML5:** Standard markup language for structuring web content.
    *   **CSS3 (with Styled Components or CSS Modules):** Styling language for defining the visual presentation of the application. Styled Components or CSS Modules will be used to scope CSS styles to individual components.

*   **Backend:**
    *   **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime environment for building server-side applications.
    *   **Express.js:** Web application framework for Node.js, providing routing and middleware functionality.
    *   **PostgreSQL:** Relational database management system (RDBMS) for storing application data (notes, users, settings, etc.).
    *   **Sequelize (or similar ORM):** Object-Relational Mapper for interacting with the database. Simplifies database queries and data manipulation.
    *   **Python (for AI Integration):** Python will be used for the backend AI integration due to the mature ecosystem of AI/ML libraries.
    *   **Flask (or similar Python web framework):** Micro web framework for Python. Used to create API endpoints for the AI functionalities.

*   **AI Integration:**
    *   **Existing AI Chrome Chat Manager Infrastructure:** Leveraging the pre-existing infrastructure for core AI functionalities (summarization, question answering, etc.). Specific APIs and data formats will be documented separately.
    *   **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Libraries (e.g., transformers, spaCy):** Python libraries used for processing and understanding natural language.
    *   **Machine Learning (ML) Frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch):** Frameworks for building and training machine learning models, if any custom AI features are developed beyond the existing Chrome Chat Manager capabilities.

*   **Other:**
    *   **WebSockets (Socket.IO):** For real-time collaboration and updates (if implemented).

### Software Development Tools

*   **IDE:** Visual Studio Code (VS Code) with relevant extensions (e.g., ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript support).
*   **Version Control:** Git (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket).
*   **Package Manager:** npm or yarn.
*   **Build Tools:** Webpack or Parcel for bundling frontend assets.
*   **Database Management Tool:** pgAdmin or Dbeaver for managing the PostgreSQL database.
*   **API Testing Tool:** Postman or Insomnia for testing backend API endpoints.

### Development Environment

*   **Operating System:** Developers can use their preferred operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).
*   **Node.js:** Version specified in the `package.json` file.
*   **PostgreSQL:** Local instance for development, with configuration managed through environment variables.
*   **Docker (Optional):** Docker and Docker Compose for containerizing the application and its dependencies. This helps ensure consistency across different development environments and simplifies deployment.
*   **Environment Variables:** Sensitive information (API keys, database credentials) will be managed through environment variables.

### Testing Strategy

*   **Unit Tests:** Jest or Mocha with Chai/Assert for testing individual components and functions. Focus on testing the logic of individual units of code in isolation.
*   **Integration Tests:** Testing the interaction between different modules or components. Examples include testing API calls and database interactions.
*   **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** Cypress or Puppeteer for testing the entire application flow from the user's perspective. Simulates user interactions and verifies the application's behavior.
*   **Manual Testing:** Manual testing by QA engineers and developers to identify usability issues and edge cases.
*   **Code Reviews:** Peer code reviews to ensure code quality and identify potential bugs.
*   **Automated Testing:** Integration with CI/CD pipeline to run automated tests on every commit.
*   **Performance Testing:** Load testing with tools like Apache JMeter to ensure the application can handle expected traffic.
*   **Security Testing:** Vulnerability scanning and penetration testing to identify and address security risks.

### Deployment Process

*   **Platform:** Cloud platform (AWS, Google Cloud Platform, Azure) or a dedicated server. The choice depends on scalability requirements and budget.
*   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Terraform or CloudFormation for managing infrastructure as code.
*   **Containerization:** Docker containers for packaging the application and its dependencies.
*   **Orchestration:** Kubernetes or Docker Compose for managing and scaling the containers.
*   **Deployment Pipeline:** Automated deployment pipeline using CI/CD tools (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions).
*   **Monitoring:** Application Performance Monitoring (APM) tools (e.g., New Relic, Datadog) for monitoring application performance and identifying issues.
*   **Logging:** Centralized logging system (e.g., ELK stack) for collecting and analyzing application logs.
*   **Blue/Green Deployment (Optional):** Strategy to minimize downtime during deployments.

### Continuous Integration Approach

*   **CI/CD Pipeline:** Automated pipeline triggered on every commit to the main branch.
*   **Version Control Integration:** Integration with Git (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket) for triggering the pipeline on code changes.
*   **Automated Build Process:** Building the application and its dependencies automatically.
*   **Automated Testing:** Running unit tests, integration tests, and E2E tests automatically.
*   **Code Analysis:** Static code analysis tools (e.g., ESLint, SonarQube) for identifying code quality issues.
*   **Artifact Repository:** Storing build artifacts (e.g., Docker images) in a repository (e.g., Docker Hub, AWS ECR).
*   **Automated Deployment:** Deploying the application to the staging or production environment automatically after successful testing.
*   **Notifications:** Notifications to developers and stakeholders on build status and deployment results.
